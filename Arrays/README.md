1. Program to reverse an array or string
2. Maximum and minimum of an array using minimum number of comparisons
3. Find Kth smallest element in an array
4. Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s
5. Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with no extra space
6. Union of two unsorted arrays
7. Union of two sorted arrays
8. Cyclically rotate an array by one
9. Given an array arr of N integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum. (kadane's Algorithm)
10. Minimum number of bribes
  -- It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue from 1 to n. Any person can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions, but they still wear their original sticker. One person can bribe at most two others. Determine the minimum number of bribes that took place to get to a given queue order. Print the number of bribes, or, if anyone has bribed more than two people, print Too chaotic.
  11. Minimum number of Swaps
  12.  Array Manipulation
  13. Merge two arrays
  14. Find Duplicate number -- Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive. There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
  15. Merge intervals
  16. Buy and sell stock -- You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.
  17. Count pairs with given sum -- Given an array of N integers, and an integer K, find the number of pairs of elements in the array whose sum is equal to K.
  18. Common elements - Given three arrays sorted in increasing order. Find the elements that are common in all three arrays.
  19. Program to rotate an array
  20. Rearrange array in alternating positive & negative items with O(1) extra space
  21. Subarray with zero sum -- Given an array of positive and negative numbers. Find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.
  22. Max product subarray -- Given an array Arr that contains N integers (may be positive, negative or zero). Find the product of the maximum product subarray.
  23. Longest consecutive subsequence -- Given an array of positive integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.
